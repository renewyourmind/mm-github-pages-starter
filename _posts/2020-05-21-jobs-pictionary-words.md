During quarantine, a popular game being played is <a href="https://www.skribbl.io">skribbl.io</a>!

This game is essentially Pictionary but online so you can play with your friends.
It is great because it can be played on any device as it is browser based.

One cool feature is that you can pass in a your own custom word list for the game to use!

Here is one I created featuring Occupations for you to use!
